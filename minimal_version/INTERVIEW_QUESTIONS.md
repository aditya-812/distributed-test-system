# Interview Questions - Minimal Distributed Test System

This document contains potential interview questions based on the minimal version implementation, organized by topic and difficulty level.

## üéØ **Core System Understanding**

### **Basic Questions**
1. **What is the overall architecture of your distributed test system?**
   - RabbitMQ as message broker running locally
   - Two Docker containers running Celery workers
   - Each worker processes only its designated task type
   - Dispatcher sends tasks concurrently and collects results

2. **Why did you choose RabbitMQ over other message brokers?**
   - Reliable message delivery guarantees
   - Excellent Python/Celery integration
   - Built-in clustering and high availability
   - Rich management interface
   - Industry standard for distributed systems

3. **How do you ensure task isolation between workers?**
   - Each worker listens to a specific queue (`queue_a` or `queue_b`)
   - Celery task routing directs tasks to correct queues
   - Docker containers provide process isolation
   - No shared state between workers

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Celery Configuration**
4. **How did you configure Celery for this system?**
   - Dynamic broker URL based on environment (Docker vs host)
   - Task routing to specific queues
   - Result backend for retrieving task results
   - Retry configuration with exponential backoff

5. **What's the difference between `broker_url` and `result_backend`?**
   - `broker_url`: Where tasks are sent (RabbitMQ)
   - `result_backend`: Where task results are stored (RPC for this implementation)

6. **How does task routing work in your implementation?**
   ```python
   task_routes = {
       'celery_app.task_a': {'queue': 'queue_a'},
       'celery_app.task_b': {'queue': 'queue_b'}
   }
   ```

### **Docker & Containerization**
7. **Why did you use Docker for the workers?**
   - Consistent environment across different machines
   - Easy scaling and orchestration
   - Process isolation
   - Simplified deployment

8. **How do containers connect to the host RabbitMQ?**
   - Using `host.docker.internal` for Docker Desktop
   - Environment variable `BROKER_URL` passed to containers
   - Port 5672 exposed from host to containers

9. **What's in your Dockerfile and why?**
   - Python 3.11 slim base image
   - Install dependencies from requirements.txt
   - Copy application code and config
   - Set working directory and default command

## üîÑ **Concurrency & Performance**

### **Concurrent Execution**
10. **How do you achieve concurrent task execution?**
    - `task_a.delay()` and `task_b.delay()` called simultaneously
    - Both tasks sent to broker before waiting for results
    - Workers process tasks in parallel
    - Dispatcher waits for both results concurrently

11. **How do you measure the benefits of concurrent execution?**
    - Compare total dispatcher time vs sum of individual task times
    - Show "Sequential time would be" calculation
    - Demonstrate that concurrent execution is faster

12. **Why do you use `time.sleep()` in your tasks?**
    - **Simulate realistic work**: Real tasks don't complete instantly
    - **Make timing measurable**: Without sleep, tasks complete in ~0.001s
    - **Demonstrate concurrent benefits**: 0.1s + 0.2s = 0.3s sequential vs ~0.2s concurrent
    - **Show scaling improvements**: Longer tasks make scaling benefits visible
    - **Realistic performance metrics**: Execution time tracking becomes meaningful

13. **What would real tasks do instead of `time.sleep()`?**
    - **Database operations**: Query databases, process results
    - **API calls**: External service requests, data processing
    - **File processing**: Read/process large files, data transformation
    - **CPU-intensive work**: Calculations, image processing, ML inference
    - **I/O operations**: Network requests, disk reads/writes

14. **What happens if one task takes much longer than the other?**
    - Dispatcher waits for both tasks to complete
    - Total time = max(task_a_time, task_b_time) + overhead
    - Still faster than sequential execution

### **Scaling & Load Testing**
13. **How does horizontal scaling work in your system?**
    - Docker Compose `--scale` command
    - Multiple workers of same type process same queue
    - Load balancing handled by RabbitMQ
    - Dynamic scaling via `scale.py` script

14. **How do you test the system under load?**
    - `load_test.py` sends multiple tasks concurrently
    - Measures throughput (tasks per second)
    - Compares performance before/after scaling
    - Shows execution time distribution

15. **What metrics do you track for performance?**
    - Individual task execution time
    - Total dispatcher time
    - Tasks per second throughput
    - Retry counts and success rates

## üõ°Ô∏è **Reliability & Error Handling**

## üîÑ **Task Distribution & Scaling Mechanics**

### **Understanding How Distribution Works**
39. **How are tasks distributed across multiple worker containers?**
    - Tasks are routed to specific queues based on task routing configuration
    - Multiple workers can consume from the same queue
    - RabbitMQ uses round-robin distribution among available workers
    - Each worker processes tasks independently and in parallel

40. **What is the role of RabbitMQ in task distribution?**
    - Acts as message broker for task distribution
    - Manages queues and message routing
    - Provides load balancing across workers
    - Ensures message delivery and persistence

41. **How does task routing ensure isolation between different task types?**
    - `task_a` ‚Üí `queue_a` ‚Üí `worker-a` containers only
    - `task_b` ‚Üí `queue_b` ‚Üí `worker-b` containers only
    - No cross-contamination between task types
    - Independent scaling of each task type

42. **What happens when you scale from 1 worker to 3 workers for the same queue?**
    - All 3 workers consume from the same queue
    - RabbitMQ distributes messages using round-robin
    - Tasks are processed in parallel across all workers
    - Throughput increases proportionally (in theory)

43. **How can you verify that tasks are actually being distributed across workers?**
    - Check Docker container logs: `docker-compose logs worker-a`
    - Monitor RabbitMQ management interface
    - Use `docker-compose ps` to see running containers
    - Look for different worker IDs processing different tasks

### **Scaling Architecture Deep Dive**
44. **Explain the complete flow from task dispatch to result collection.**
    1. `dispatch.py` calls `task_a.delay()` or `task_b.delay()`
    2. Celery sends message to RabbitMQ
    3. RabbitMQ routes message to appropriate queue (`queue_a` or `queue_b`)
    4. Available worker consumes message from queue
    5. Worker processes task and stores result
    6. `result.get()` retrieves result from result backend

45. **What are the key components in the scaling architecture?**
    - **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ for task distribution
    - **Task Queues**: `queue_a` and `queue_b` for task routing
    - **Worker Containers**: Docker containers running Celery workers
    - **Result Backend**: RPC for storing and retrieving task results
    - **Dispatcher**: Script that sends tasks and collects results

46. **How does Docker Compose enable horizontal scaling?**
    - `docker-compose up -d --scale worker-a=3` creates 3 instances
    - Each instance runs the same worker code
    - All instances connect to the same RabbitMQ broker
    - RabbitMQ automatically distributes tasks among them

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Scaling Limitations & Solutions**

### **Understanding Scaling Challenges**
47. **Why doesn't scaling always reduce total execution time dramatically?**
    - Sequential result collection bottleneck
    - Task execution time vs. network overhead
    - Docker container overhead
    - Message routing and serialization costs

48. **What is the sequential result collection bottleneck?**
    - Each `task.get()` call blocks until that specific task completes
    - Even with parallel task execution, results are collected one by one
    - Total time limited by slowest task, not parallel execution capability
    - This is often the biggest performance limitation

49. **When does horizontal scaling provide the most benefit?**
    - CPU-intensive tasks (image processing, data analysis)
    - I/O-bound operations (API calls, database queries)
    - Long-running tasks (minutes, not seconds)
    - High-volume processing (thousands of tasks)

50. **What are the main overhead factors in distributed task processing?**
    - Network latency for message routing
    - Task serialization/deserialization
