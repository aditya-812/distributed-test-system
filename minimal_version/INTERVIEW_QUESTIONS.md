# Interview Questions - Minimal Distributed Test System

This document contains potential interview questions based on the minimal version implementation, organized by topic and difficulty level.

## üéØ **Core System Understanding**

### **Basic Questions**
1. **What is the overall architecture of your distributed test system?**
   - RabbitMQ as message broker running locally
   - Two Docker containers running Celery workers
   - Each worker processes only its designated task type
   - Dispatcher sends tasks concurrently and collects results

2. **Why did you choose RabbitMQ over other message brokers?**
   - Reliable message delivery guarantees
   - Excellent Python/Celery integration
   - Built-in clustering and high availability
   - Rich management interface
   - Industry standard for distributed systems

3. **How do you ensure task isolation between workers?**
   - Each worker listens to a specific queue (`queue_a` or `queue_b`)
   - Celery task routing directs tasks to correct queues
   - Docker containers provide process isolation
   - No shared state between workers

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Celery Configuration**
4. **How did you configure Celery for this system?**
   - Dynamic broker URL based on environment (Docker vs host)
   - Task routing to specific queues
   - Result backend for retrieving task results
   - Retry configuration with exponential backoff

5. **What's the difference between `broker_url` and `result_backend`?**
   - `broker_url`: Where tasks are sent (RabbitMQ)
   - `result_backend`: Where task results are stored (RPC for this implementation)

6. **How does task routing work in your implementation?**
   ```python
   task_routes = {
       'celery_app.task_a': {'queue': 'queue_a'},
       'celery_app.task_b': {'queue': 'queue_b'}
   }
   ```

### **Docker & Containerization**
7. **Why did you use Docker for the workers?**
   - Consistent environment across different machines
   - Easy scaling and orchestration
   - Process isolation
   - Simplified deployment

8. **How do containers connect to the host RabbitMQ?**
   - Using `host.docker.internal` for Docker Desktop
   - Environment variable `BROKER_URL` passed to containers
   - Port 5672 exposed from host to containers

9. **What's in your Dockerfile and why?**
   - Python 3.11 slim base image
   - Install dependencies from requirements.txt
   - Copy application code and config
   - Set working directory and default command

## üîÑ **Concurrency & Performance**

### **Concurrent Execution**
10. **How do you achieve concurrent task execution?**
    - `task_a.delay()` and `task_b.delay()` called simultaneously
    - Both tasks sent to broker before waiting for results
    - Workers process tasks in parallel
    - Dispatcher waits for both results concurrently

11. **How do you measure the benefits of concurrent execution?**
    - Compare total dispatcher time vs sum of individual task times
    - Show "Sequential time would be" calculation
    - Demonstrate that concurrent execution is faster

12. **What happens if one task takes much longer than the other?**
    - Dispatcher waits for both tasks to complete
    - Total time = max(task_a_time, task_b_time) + overhead
    - Still faster than sequential execution

### **Scaling & Load Testing**
13. **How does horizontal scaling work in your system?**
    - Docker Compose `--scale` command
    - Multiple workers of same type process same queue
    - Load balancing handled by RabbitMQ
    - Dynamic scaling via `scale.py` script

14. **How do you test the system under load?**
    - `load_test.py` sends multiple tasks concurrently
    - Measures throughput (tasks per second)
    - Compares performance before/after scaling
    - Shows execution time distribution

15. **What metrics do you track for performance?**
    - Individual task execution time
    - Total dispatcher time
    - Tasks per second throughput
    - Retry counts and success rates

## üõ°Ô∏è **Reliability & Error Handling**

### **Retry Mechanisms**
16. **How do you handle task failures?**
    - Automatic retries with exponential backoff
    - Max 3 retries per task
    - Retry delays: 5s, 10s, 20s
    - Track retry count in task results

17. **What types of failures can your retry mechanism handle?**
    - Network connectivity issues
    - Temporary resource unavailability
    - Transient errors in task execution
    - Broker connection problems

18. **How do you prevent infinite retry loops?**
    - Maximum retry count (3)
    - Exponential backoff with jitter
    - Task eventually fails after max retries

### **Configuration & Monitoring**
19. **How do you manage configuration across the system?**
    - YAML-based configuration in `test-config.yml`
    - Centralized config loading in `celery_app.py`
    - Environment-specific settings (Docker vs host)
    - Validation and error handling for missing config

20. **What monitoring do you implement?**
    - Task execution timing
    - Retry count tracking
    - Worker status via Docker Compose
